# ESO Internship Project: Thermographic camera for telescope maintenance

This project is established in the context of the Summer Students Chile 2021 internship program of the European Southern Observatory (ESO). The project's objective is to get practice and be familiar with the IoT technology using a small thermal camera to be deployed in the field in our telescopes for maintenance purposes.

This project was developed using the [Infrared Thermal Sensor MLX90640](https://www.mouser.cl/new/melexis/melexis-mlx90640-fir-sensor/) and the [single board development kit nRF52840 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf52840-dk).

For more details, see the attached presentation.

## :mag_right: Requirements

* Python 3 or latest
* MOSS User ID, you can get one [here](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/)
* [Amazon S3 Bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for plagiarism reports storage

## :floppy_disk: Installation

1. Clone this repository and navigate into it

    ```git clone https://github.com/VadokDev/MOSS-UTFSM```
    
    ```cd MOSS-UTFSM```

2. Rename the .env.example file to .env
3. Configure environment variables in the .env file
    * MOSS_ID=
    * ENDPOINT_URL=
    * AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
    * AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
    * REGION_NAME=

3. Install dependences from requirements.txt (it's recommended to use [Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html))

    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## :snake: Usage

1. Create a new Course folder inside ```data``` to store the students and homework files, for example, ```CSJ-INF131-2021-01```
2. Create a ```students``` folder inside the Course folder and put the [SIGA](https://siga.usm.cl/) exported students lists (.xls) in it, for example, ```data/CSJ-INF131-2021-01/students```.
2. Download from [AULA](https://aula.usm.cl/) the student howeworks zip file and extract it in a new folder with the homework's name inside the folder created in step 1, for example, ```data/CSJ-INF131-2021-01/T1```. 
3. Run the program with 
	
    ```python main.py [Language] [CourseFolder] [Homework] [SimilarityPercent]```
	
    Where:
    * Language: the programming language used for plagiarism detection; see available list in [MossService.py](/app/services/MossService.py#L17-L43)
    * CourseFolder: name of the folder created in ```data``` for store student and homework files
    * Homework: name of the homework folder in the CourseFolder
    * SimilarityPercent: % of similarity between two homework to classify them as plagiarism
    
    Example: ```python main.py python CSJ-INF131-2021-01 T1 60```
    
4. Copy the MOSS URL output; that URL stores the complete MOSS plagiarism report. 

5. Go to the ```results``` folder inside the Course folder and open the folder with the name of the homework used (for example. ```data/CSJ-INF131-2021-01/results/T1```), here you'll find:
	* web/: folder with the entire MOSS report website
	* [section]/: folder with the high similarity homework of students in [section] (example: Section 201 students)
	* inter/: folder with the high similarity homework of students from different sections
	* not found/: folder with the high similarity homework of students that weren't found in the students .xls files
	* [homework] [timestamp].xls: excel report with the detail of high similarity homework and their students.
